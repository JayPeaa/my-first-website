# My very first webpage

Welcome!

The aim of this project was to start utilising HTML5 and CSS3 to implement some of the
teachings from the fundaentals sections.

It also allowed for the oportunity to creat links, navigations, use images (hotlinking - not best practice)
and other things.

As part of this assignment we coverd the terminal, GIT and GITHUB.  I can now use GIT and push my work
to GITHUB amongst other things.
